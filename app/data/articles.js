        <div class="space-y-6">
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Period poverty is a significant issue affecting millions of people worldwide. In our local communities, we've discovered that this problem is more widespread than many realize.</p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Hidden Crisis</h2>
          <p>Recent studies show that 1 in 5 students have struggled to afford menstrual products, leading to missed school days and decreased academic performance. This isn't just a health issueâ€”it's an educational equity issue.</p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Impact on Education</h2>
          <p>Students often miss school during their periods due to lack of access to menstrual products. This creates a cycle where those who menstruate fall behind academically, affecting their future opportunities.</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>Average of 5 school days missed per month</li>
            <li>Decreased participation in sports and activities</li>
            <li>Lower test scores and grades</li>
            <li>Increased dropout rates</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">What Flow Forward Is Doing</h2>
          <p>Our organization is working to address this issue through multiple initiatives:</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>Monthly product drives in partnership with local schools</li>
            <li>Educational workshops on menstrual health</li>
            <li>Advocacy for policy changes in educational institutions</li>
            <li>Building sustainable supply chains for ongoing support</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Together, we can ensure that no one has to choose between their education and their dignity.</p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Understanding your menstrual cycle is crucial for overall health and wellbeing. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know.</p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Menstrual Cycle Basics</h2>
          <p>The menstrual cycle typically lasts 21-35 days, with the average being 28 days. It's controlled by hormones and involves several phases:</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5):</strong> The lining of the uterus sheds</li>
            <li><strong>Follicular Phase (Days 1-13):</strong> Eggs mature in the ovaries</li>
            <li><strong>Ovulation (Day 14):</strong> An egg is released</li>
            <li><strong>Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):</strong> The uterus prepares for potential pregnancy</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Choosing the Right Products</h2>
          <p>There are many menstrual products available, each with their own benefits:</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Pads:</strong> External protection, easy to use</li>
            <li><strong>Tampons:</strong> Internal protection, good for active lifestyles</li>
            <li><strong>Menstrual Cups:</strong> Reusable, environmentally friendly</li>
            <li><strong>Period Underwear:</strong> Built-in protection, comfortable</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">When to Seek Help</h2>
          <p>Consult a healthcare provider if you experience:</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>Severe pain that interferes with daily activities</li>
            <li>Very heavy bleeding (changing products every hour)</li>
            <li>Periods lasting longer than 7 days</li>
            <li>Irregular cycles or missed periods</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Remember, menstrual health is an important part of overall health, and you deserve access to proper care and products.</p>
